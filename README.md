Australia has been undergoing a rapid transformation in its energy landscape as part of its commitment to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050 (United Nations, 2015). This transition is being driven by national strategies aimed at reducing reliance on fossil fuels and accelerating the adoption of cleaner energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro. This project is motivated by the growing need for clear and accessible insights into Australia’s energy transition. While large-scale datasets are available, they often remain inaccessible or difficult to interpret for non-specialists.

I designed a narrative visualisation dashboard that integrates multiple coordinated views. The main visualisation presents a stacked area chart showing Australia’s national electricity generation by energy source (1999–2025), highlighting the structural shift from fossil fuels to renewables. Complementary components include a sunburst chart and bar toggle for exploring monthly breakdowns, a map showing state-level energy volumes, and time-series charts that compare trends in generation, emissions, and intensity across five major states.
The core message I aim to convey is that Australia is experiencing a dynamic and regionally differentiated energy transition. My visualisation reveals not only the long-term shift from coal to renewables but also the evolving composition of the national energy portfolio, including the rising role of solar and the decarbonisation impact at state level.
The intended audience are energy analysts and researchers, who require historical patterns and regional comparisons to inform policy or investment. By guiding users through key findings with interactive and layered visuals, our dashboard transforms raw electricity data into a meaningful narrative of Australia’s transition toward a cleaner and more diversified energy system. I chose electricity generation as the narrative anchor because it serves as a concrete indicator of how different energy sources are consumed and offers a measurable lens to understand structural shifts in Australia’s energy mix over time.
